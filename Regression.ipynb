        "Ans  Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a foundational statistical method used to model the relationship between two quantitative variables: one dependent (target) variable and one independent (predictor) variable. The objective is to fit a straight line that best predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variable."

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans   1. Linearity\n",
        "The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is assumed to be linear. This means that changes in X lead to proportional changes in Y. If the relationship is non-linear, the linear regression model may not provide accurate predictions.\n",
        "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Independence of Errors\n",
        "The residuals (errors) of the regression model are assumed to be independent of each other. This implies that the error associated with one observation does not provide information about the error associated with another observation. Violation of this assumption can occur in time series data, where consecutive observations may be correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Homoscedasticity\n",
        "The variance of the residuals is assumed to be constant across all levels of the independent variable. In other words, the spread or dispersion of the residuals should be uniform along the range of X. If the variance changes (a condition known as heteroscedasticity), it can lead to inefficient estimates and affect the statistical tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normality of Errors\n",
        "The residuals are assumed to be approximately normally distributed. This assumption is particularly important for conducting valid hypothesis tests and constructing confidence intervals. If the residuals deviate significantly from normality, the reliability of these statistical inferences may be compromised.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. No Perfect Multicollinearity\n",
        "In multiple linear regression (involving more than one independent variable), it is assumed that no independent variable is a perfect linear function of any other independent variable. Perfect multicollinearity makes it impossible to isolate the individual effect of each predictor variable on the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. No Endogeneity\n",
        "The independent variables are assumed to be uncorrelated with the error term. If an independent variable is correlated with the error term, it leads to endogeneity, resulting in biased and inconsistent estimates."
